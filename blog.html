                <h3>FUCK-TON OF FIREWORKS!</h3>
                It really must suck to be a brit..
                <p>so, today i went into town to one of the firework stands (example photo below) and got almost $200 worth of fireworks! Crazy how easy it is to get what are basically bombs, lol. Last time we tried to get big ones they exploded on the ground and hit our neighbors car.. Hopefully this time will be different.</p>
